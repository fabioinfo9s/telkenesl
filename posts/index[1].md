# Welcome to telk learning to blog
Im not too sure what to write for my first proper blog so here is just some place holder text that I feel like putting here to see how well it goes. I made this site using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) with React and [Bulma](https://bulma.io) for css. Idk what else to write here other than this is my first proper react project and I dont really like react. Quite confusing having the getStaticProps and the getStaticPaths stuff. Also not used to es6 with import and export compared to require and module.exports in CJS. I guess I havent really dived deep into react and use the features which are conviniet. Most of the stuff that I have in this blog is quite simple components with nothing needing a state. Probably could have made this blog using ejs considering most of the stuff is static but I wanted to learn react and nextjs so why not make a blog as well.
