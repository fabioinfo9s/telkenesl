# 1 Year of Linux

## Background stuff
So its been a year since I moved to linux... Personally I have several thoughts about linux compared to windows and macos. Firstly, I mainly used MacOS before linux so this has made my opinions a bit based towards macos. This made it quite difficult to use Windows when I needed to use it for schoolwork as its keybinds are super weird (as a mac user). On linux at least I could change my keybinds to more mac-like but this has brought up some issues that I will bring up later. 

## Initial impressions
I started using linux with Zorin OS and honestly it was quite easy to move over from macos. Just needed to switch meta/super with ctrl so it has more of a mac like keybind. It is a bit unconvential but my keyboard is based on mac meaning that windows key and alt is physically switched. This made zorin have "mac" like keybinds with the exception of switching apps using alt+tab rather than meta/super + tab. This was completely fine and I still use that keybind even after moving away from Zorin. Initial thoughts were just I could switch to any os that has a browser because my workflow is that simple. Everything that I do that is school related can be done in the browser. 

### School stuff 
1. Word/Microsoft Suite - just using the online microsoft suite was enough for me. This lead to a bit of issues with not being able to add fucking line of regression in graphs.
2. Teams - there is an official microsoft app as a .deb but after trying it for months and even using the insider version, I feel like it is just a fucking laughable product. Windows and MacOS has had a new teams UI while linux is basically on the same build as the browser version. I ended up just using my browser to connect through teams as it is 1 less app to download and it runs better from experience.

### Other apps I use
I dont really do much other than code and play mc so yea... moving was quite simple as mc runs java and java runs basically anywhere. Also vscode exists on linux so that was cool (probs one of the decent microsoft products).

### Overall thoughts
Like honestly if your workflow is simple and mostly revolves around the browser, switching to linux is quite painless just with the exception of troubleshooting may be more troublesome. This wasn't really an issue for me as I had some online friends who were willing to help me when I had some troubles.

## Switching to Manjaro then Arch
While I liked Zorin, I wanted to try Manjaro so I ended up triple booting (Zorin, Manjaro, and Windows) to have a feel of Manjaro. Initially it was the same as Zorin with it basically allowing me to do whatever I normally do. I like to edit my stuff to fit what I like to I was quite happy with switching to Manjaro KDE. Editing was dope so yea... back to a macos like system lmao.

### Thoughts on Manjaro
While I didn't hate using manjaro, I felt like pacmac (the preinstalled GUI package manager) was very slow. While my laptop was slow as well, it was painfully slow to search for items and loading them also took a while. Quite a bit of bloat that I never ended up using so yea... quite a weird experience. If I were to reinstall Manjaro, I would probably just remove pacmac and install yay. 

### Thoughts on Arch
So in this year, I have installed arch 2 times and I feel like it isnt that bad of an experience. Just following the arch wiki was good enough. I cheated a bit by partioning my drive beforehand as honestly I don't like doing math while in the terminal. AUR is dope to use and makes installing stuff so much easier compared to anything on MacOS and Windows.

## Other stuff
I think my view is quite hard to relate to as I do not really do much on my computer. Just mostly browser based stuff and a bit of gaming. Idk what else to comment about when switching over from a different as I still use Windows occasionally for gaming and schoolwork.
