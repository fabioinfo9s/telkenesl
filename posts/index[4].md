# Why youtube removing dislike count doesn't matter (to me)

**Kinda short rant and poorly structured arguments... tell me what you think thou**

## Youtube's side
In Youtube's [blog](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-to-youtube/) and their [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxOuG8jMIgI), they state that they removed the dislike button to "better protect our creators from harassment, and reduce dislike attacks" 

While I do believe that this does happen, their additional statement that "But because the count was not visible to them, we found that they were less likely to target a videoâ€™s dislike button to drive up the count." I think is quite a weird statement to make. For starters, I think that people like to flock and have justification to do a certain action. Thus if you have a small feeling that a video is bad and you see quite a lot of dislikes, you are more likely to dislike as it is "what everyone else" thinks as well. If what they say is true, I still do not see how removing the dislike counter will reduce mass disliking of videos as the creator (the person who will "suffer" from this attack) will still be able to see it. 

## Why it doesnt matter to me
Contrary to a normal user, I never touch the like or dislike button. I also do not look at like or dislikes on videos to judge wheter it is a good video or not. If it is a tutorial, I tend to go straight to the comments especially if it is something more sketchy (such as free bobux hacks!!!). While comments are more heavily controlled than likes and dislikes, they actually include useful critism and actual context. 100k dislikes to 10k likes doesnt mean that much compared to a comment saying that "This video has a lot of misinformation and is biased." 

While I think that the dislike button is useful to quickly judge if a video is good or not, I do not use it and our ways of using youtube may differ and I respect that.
